# Modelproject

Our project is titled "The Richard Meltzer Model" and is about the Richard Meltzer model, which sets up a relation between the income distribution in a society and the preferred degree of redistribution. In section 1.1, we will setup the model and introduce the importance of the difference between a mean income and median income on the preferred tax rate. In section 1.2, we will illustrate the model for three different income distributions; the gamma distribution, the chi2 distribution and the exponential distribution.

The results of the project can be seen from running modelproject.ipynb.


Dependencies: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation the project requires no further installations.
