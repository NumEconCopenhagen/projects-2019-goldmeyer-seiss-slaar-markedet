# Dataproject

Our project is found as the file "dataProject".

Part 1.1 ("Scraper") and 1.2 ("Data mining") explain how we have scraped data from Nordnet in week 12.
However, as the trading data on Nordnet, which we are using, isn't to be found for earlier days, the scraper can be used to extract new data, whereas it can't be used to find the exact data that we have used for this project.
For this reason we have attached the csv file "data".

Hence, the reader are to run parts 1.3 ("Data analysis") and forthgoing.

Hope you'll enjoy the read.
